## Background

In this work, I will generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike).

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so the task is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Task

* Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs for year 2018 and find two unexpected phenomena. 

* Design visualizations for each discovered phenomena. 

* How many trips have been recorded total during year 2018?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

Next,

* Use the visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
* The dashboards accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 


* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

Finally, create final presentation

* Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
